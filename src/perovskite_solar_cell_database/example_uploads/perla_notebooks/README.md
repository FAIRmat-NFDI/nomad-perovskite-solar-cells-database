# PERLA Notebooks

This collection of Jupyter notebooks provides comprehensive analysis tools for perovskite solar cell data from [**PERLA** (Perovskite Living Archive)](https://fairmat-nfdi.github.io/perla/) in NOMAD.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

**Data Access**: A required `perovskite_solar_cell_database.parquet` file tu run the notebooks is automatically included when this example upload is loaded in NOMAD. This is the one we used to generate the analysis in the notebooks that lead to the PERLA paper. Alternatively, you can generate it yourself using [query-perovskite-database.ipynb](query-perovskite-database.ipynb) (can take ~30 min due to API rate limits)


### Running the Notebooks

You can run these notebooks directly in NORTH, in the general NOMAD Jupyter environment.
