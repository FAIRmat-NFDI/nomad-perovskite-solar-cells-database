# How to add a new ion to the database
In NOMAD, we have set up a database over perovskite ions. This one can be used when creating the perovksite compositions. It can also be used to explore the ions that have been used for perovskites, visualize those ions, or download data for them, including a .cif file. <br>

The documentation below contains instructions for the following tasks:

- Create a new ion object in NOMAD
- Download a JSON file with ion data from your own upload
- Sharing your new ion file by uploading it to the Perovskite Ion database in NOMAD database
