# How to add a new ion to the database

The [Halide Perovskite Ions Database](https://nomad-lab.eu/prod/v1/develop/gui/search/perovskite-ions), compiles a set of more than 300 entries of ions used in halide perovskites compounds. This one can be used to explore potential ions for perovskites, visualize those ions, or download its structured data. This dataset can be extended for new ions by uploading new data to the NOMAD repository following the steps below.
