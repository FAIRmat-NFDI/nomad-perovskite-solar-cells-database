# Explore the databases

The most efficient way to explore the databases is to use the search applications.


## Search perovskite solar cells

In the [The Perovskite Database Project app](https://nomad-lab.eu/prod/v1/develop/gui/search/perovskite-solar-cells-database) you can combine different filters to target what you are looking for. For exmaple, we can search for solar cells that contain Sn in the perovskite composition and in which C60 has been used as an electron transport layer.

Then you can navigate to the individual entries by clicking in the results table row or by clicking directly in your poin of interests in the scatter plot.

## Search ions

In a similar way, you can look in the [Ion Database app](https://nomad-lab.eu/prod/v1/develop/gui/search/perovskite-ions) for ions that have been used in halide perovskites. You can filter by the elements or use two dimentionsal filters in the scatter plot, to looks for bulky ions with a large number of atoms and a high molecular weight.

## Copy the serach query for the API

Sometimes, you need to use the API to work with larger data programatically.
The GUI provides you some helpers to build the API call. You can use the "Copy API call" `< >` button to copy the API call to the clipboard and then paste it in your code

You can read more about using the API in the [NOMAD API documentation](https://nomad-lab.eu/prod/v1/develop/docs/howto/programmatic/api.html).
